1. Clone repository
2. Open repository location in Command Line
3. To open cypress you can use for e.g. this command:: npx cypress open
4. To run tests in headless mode you can use for e.g. this command: npx cypress run --headless --browser chrome

NOTE: Couple tests will fail, I've marked them with "BUG" prefix. I've put short comments in code why it fails and what needs to be done to pass.
